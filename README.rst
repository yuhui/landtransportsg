This is an unofficial Python package for interacting with APIs available at
`LTA DataMall`_.

.. _LTA DataMall: https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html

Installing the package
----------------------

Install the package using ``pip``::

    pip install landtransportsg

Using the package
-----------------

Pre-requisite:

- API key from LTA. `Request for API access`_.

.. _Request for API access: https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html

The main steps are:

1. Import a client class.
2. Instantiate an object from the client class.
3. Call a function on that object.

For more information, `refer to the documentation`_.

.. _refer to the documentation: http://landtransportsg.readthedocs.io/

Usage overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Interacting with `LTA DataMall`_'s API is done through one of four clients,
where each client corresponds with a set of endpoints.

The four clients are:

- ``ActiveMobility``
- ``Geospatial``
- ``PublicTransport``
- ``Traffic``

Each client contains several public functions, one function per endpoint. A
function's name is the same as its corresponding endpoint's ending path.

Some functions accept named arguments, where an argument corresponds with a
parameter that the endpoint accepts.

    *Why have separate clients instead of one single client?*

    Without knowing how `LTA DataMall`_'s API will evolve, and noticing that
    the endpoints were themselves already partitioned into sets, it seemed like
    a good idea to keep each set of endpoints in its own contextual client. This
    allows for each set of endpoints to be customised on their own, e.g. the
    ``PublicTransport`` passenger volume-related endpoints allow for a string
    to be returned, whereas the other endpoints return a list.
